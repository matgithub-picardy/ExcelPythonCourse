    "# Tutorial 7: Using Python in Excel files\n",
    "\n",
    "Excel is highly rated by professionals for its user-friendly interface. As a result:\n",
    "- It's a popular tool for data management and analysis.\n",
    "- Excel is widely used in a wide range of organizations, including private companies, public institutions, universities and so on.\n",
    "- Professionals in a wide variety of positions - analysts, managers, executives, researchers - use Excel on a daily basis.\n",
    "- It enables both rapid statistical calculations and more advanced data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given its wide adoption, mastering Excel is essential for data professionals, data scientists and academics. Although Excel is excellent for small tasks and quick calculations, it has limitations for larger datasets and more complex analyses, which require the use of more powerful languages, like Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is currently the most popular general-purpose programming language worldwide. Compared to Excel, Python offers:\n",
    "- Powerful advantages for data analysis,\n",
    "- A more flexible, efficient, and scalable approach,\n",
    "- The ability to automate repetitive tasks and handle large datasets that might challenge Excel, and\n",
    "- Advanced analysis capabilities through libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, Python is open-source, allowing continuous development and access to a vast ecosystem of tools that extend its functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining Python with Excel can bring out the best in both tools. Python libraries like pandas make it easy to work directly with Excel files, enabling you to leverage Excel’s simplicity alongside Python’s computational power. This tutorial will guide you through integrating the two for enhanced data processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is more efficient than Excel for automating data processing tasks, including the processing of Excel files. Pandas offers very interesting methods for reading any type of data from Excel files. You can also export your Pandas results to Excel, if that's what your target audience prefers. Pandas is ideal for other routine data analysis tasks, such as :\n",
    "- rapid exploratory data analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- drawing attractive graphs\n",
    "- feeding data into machine learning tools such as scikit-learn\n",
    "- building machine learning models on your data transferring cleaned and processed data to a large number of data tools</font> <a id='home'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this tutorial is to show you how to work with Excel files in Pandas. We will cover the following concepts:\n",
    "- setting up a computer with the necessary software\n",
    "- reading data from Excel files into pandas\n",
    "- exploring data in Pandas\n",
    "- visualizing data in Pandas using the matplotlib visualization library\n",
    "- manipulating and reshaping data in Pandas\n",
    "- transferring data from Pandas to Excel\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data set <a id=\"dataset\"></a> ([top](#home))\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will work with a multi-sheet Excel file created from Kaggle's IMDb Scores data. You can download the file in the left-hand panel if you are working on Binder or by clicking on the following link: [movies.xlsx](https://github.com/matgithub-picardy/ExcelPythonCourse/raw/refs/heads/main/movies.xlsx).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we can open the Excel file for an initial exploration of the data. Each line (observation) corresponds to a film, with information about that film: year, genre, language, country, budget, etc. First, we'll describe the database (1916 to 2016, American movies, etc.), propose some initial statistics on the database, and then determine the distribution of the films' audience ratings, identify the films with the highest audience ratings, net revenues, etc. We'll analyze and explore this data first in Excel, then use Python, so that you can see by yourself how well Pandas can work with Excel data in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading data from the Excel file <a id=\"reading\"></a> ([top](#home))\n",
    "A quick examination of the Excel file reveals three sheets containing information on mostly American films: '1900s,' '2000s,' and '2010s.' The titles of the sheets indicate that the films correspond to these years (but we'll have to be sure). \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we need to import the data from the Excel file into pandas. To do that, we start by importing the pandas module. Run the code in the cell below by clicking on the cell and pressing Shift+Enter:"

    "Pandas is not intended to replace Excel; on the contrary, the two tools complement each other well in a data analysis workflow. While Excel is widely used and very accessible, Pandas provides powerful tools for performing complex data manipulation and analysis that is often beyond the capabilities of Excel alone. One of the main advantages of using Python with Pandas is the ability to automate data processing, integrating it seamlessly into your data flow by writing reusable scripts. Pandas also makes it easy to read and export data to Excel files, allowing you to share results in a format familiar to colleagues who prefer Excel.\n",
