The data is the same as that used at the end of the previous tutorial, describing online advertising campaigns for a music streaming platform. The file contains data on 74 online advertising campaigns with the following variables:\n",
    "- **Campaign_ID:** Unique identifier for each campaign\n",
    "- **Campaign_Name:** Name of each campaign\n",
    "- **Genre:** Genre targeted by the campaign\n",
    "- **Target_Audience:** Primary audience\n",

    "We'll exploit the campaign data by calculating meaningful indicators to identify the best-performing campaigns. Let's get started!\n",
    " \n",

    " ### Calculating total impressions for the quarter: Function `SUM`\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the reach of all campaigns, let’s calculate the total number of *Impressions* generated across campaigns. This will help us understand the potential audience reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a sum in Excel, follow these steps:\n",
    "- Click on the cell where you want the sum to appear (e.g.,``H76`).\n",
    "- Type `=SUM(` to begin the formula.\n",
    "- While holding down the Shift key, click on the starting cell (`H2`), then click on the ending cell (`H75`). This will select the range``H2:H75`.\n",
    "- Press Enter to complete the formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now see the total number of *Impressions* across all campaigns. You must have realized that it's not even necessary to add the right parenthesis! Alternatively, you can hold down the left mouse button to drag and select the cells from H2 to H75 instead of using the Shift key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The video below shows how to use the function `SUM` in Excel (source: YouTube channel \"Microsoft 365\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%\">\n",

    "        <figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Microsoft Excel</figcaption>\n",
    "    </figure>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also access the `SUM` function via the tabs / menus, but this is less practical and finding a function can sometimes be a bit tedious! In what follows, we'll be learning new functions as and when we need them, and we'll be writing them directly into a cell. Excel will then automatically fill in the function name and indicate the parameters to be entered. This approach is simpler and faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating the average Click-Through Rate (CTR): Function `AVERAGE`\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the engagement level of the campaigns, let’s calculate the average Click-Through Rate (%):\n",
    "1. Select the cell where you want the result (e.g., `I76`).\n",
    "2. Type `=AVERAGE(`\n",
    "3. Select the range of CTR values (`I2:I75`).\n",
    "4. Press Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives you the average CTR across all campaigns, helping you benchmark individual campaign performance. A good practice may be to indicate the content of the cell in an adjacent cell (\"Impressions sum\" or \"Moy. CTR\").\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating bonus payouts for top campaigns: Function `IF`\n",
    "\n",
    "The music streaming service wants to reward high-performing campaigns with a bonus. If a campaign’s Engagement Score is above 70, it receives a &#36;500 bonus; otherwise, it receives no bonus:\n",
    "1. Select the cell for the bonus calculation (e.g., `M2`).\n",
    "2. Type `=IF(`. Note that a help box appears to remind you of the function's syntax.\n",
    "3. Set up the formula as follows (each value must be separated by a comma for Excel or a semicolon for LibreOffice):\n",
    "   - **Logical Test**: `L2 > 70` (K2 being the Engagement Score)\n",
    "   - **Value if True**: `500`\n",
    "   - **Value if False**: `0`\n",
    "4. Drag the formula down to apply it to all campaigns.\n",

    "1. **Total ad spend:** Use the `SUM` function on the Ad Spend (USD) column.\n",
    "2. **Highest conversion rate:** Use the `MAX` function on the Conversion Rate (\\%) column to identify the best-performing campaign.\n",

    "Discover the potential of pivot tables to easily summarize and analyze large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pivot tables (referred to as TCD for \"Tableau Croisé Dynamique\" in French) are a highly useful feature in Excel, commonly used across industries for data analysis. A pivot table allows you to summarize large datasets and perform calculations based on specified criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explain what a pivot table is, based literally on the words of its French translation:\n",
    " - **Table:** In Excel, a table is a set of data organized in rows and columns, as in a database. Each column represents a different variable (month, salesperson, product family, etc.), and each row a record (an entry in the dataset), for example, sales in a specific month for a specific salesperson.\n",
    " - **Crossed:** Variables are said to be crossed because the data is analyzed by combining categories. You may want to see sales data broken down both by month and by salesperson, for example, total sales for each salesperson for each month. This “crossover” view allows you to see interactions between two or more variables in the same table. So, instead of looking at sales data only by month or by salesperson, we cross-reference them for a more detailed analysis.\n",
    " - **Dynamic:** The table can be adjusted automatically as data changes. If you update the original data, you can quickly update the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pivot tables can help analyze metrics such as monthly revenue, content type, and creator contributions. This section will walk through creating a pivot table using sales data and explore ways to use it for insights.\n",

    "### Steps to create a pivot table\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s create a pivot table to calculate total revenue by month and by content type. To create a pivot table in Excel, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy and paste the data above in an Excel sheet \n",
    "2. Ensure your data is clean, with no empty rows or columns, and each column has a title.\n",
    "3. Go to the **Insert** tab in Excel and click **Pivot Table**.\n",
    "4. Select the range of your data.\n",
    "5. Choose where to place the pivot table (usually in a new worksheet).\n",
    "6. Use the **Fields Pane** to build your table by dragging columns (fields) into Rows, Columns, Values, or Filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a pivot table, you can specify fields as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rows**: Categories like months or creators (used for sorting data).\n",
    "- **Columns**: Fields you want separated in columns, such as content type.\n",
    "- **Values**: The numerical data you want to analyze, e.g., total revenue.\n",
    "- **Filters**: Optional filters that let you refine data display, such as filtering by a specific content type or creator.\n",

    "### Theoretical issues of pivot tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pivot tables are very useful in economics because they allow analysts to **break down and summarise data** across several dimensions. This **reveals patterns** and information that are often hidden in the raw data, particularly when dealing with large datasets with many variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplifying complex relationships:** in economic analysis, it is often necessary to understand how different factors interact with each other and influence results. Pivot tables allow us to quickly summarise data in order to observe these interactions. This quick summary helps economists discover patterns without complex coding or in-depth statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Monthly sales by region and product type: An analysis of sales data by month, region and product type can help identify seasonal trends and regional preferences.\n",
    "- Employment by sector and year: By breaking down employment data by sector and year, we can identify trends in employment growth or decline in certain sectors over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Proposing a preliminary approach prior to econometric analysis**\n",
    "Econometrics focuses on quantifying relationships between variables and testing hypotheses. Pivot tables are useful in this respect because they allow us to :\n",
    "- Find raw trends and correlations: Before moving on to advanced econometric models, pivot tables allow us to see raw associations. For example, trends in income levels as a function of education levels).\n",
    "- Identify interaction effects: Grouping data into categories allows us to analyse possible interaction effects, such as how two variables combined (for example, age and education) influence a third variable (income). This makes it possible to determine which variables should be included in further econometric modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **A real example: Examining the impact of a policy**\n",
    "Economists frequently use pivot tables to examine the impact of policies. For example, after an increase in the minimum wage, a pivot table showing employment levels by sector and by region could provide a quick indication of whether the number of jobs has changed significantly in sectors that rely heavily on minimum wage labour. This type of breakdown makes it easy to analyse whether the effects vary according to region or industry before implementing a more complex model."
